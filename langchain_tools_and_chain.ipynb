Pranayama serves as a powerful ritual to shift your mindset. It helps to calm the nervous system and can be very beneficial to share with our children as well. At times, I have found my children using their relaxed breathing to calm themselves from stress or anxiety. Pranayama is a practice that can be done in the morning to prepare for the day and in the afternoon, before picking up your children from school, to prepare for their return home.\n",

Getting up first for “you” time, before taking care of everyone else, will make you feel more alive and available for your family. This practice is the “the gem” or “true medicine” of life. Silence is golden. When you sit in quiet and stillness, you are able to cultivate your intuition and receive sacred messages. Think of this practice as a time to take a break from talking all the time, or disciplining all the time. It is a life-changer!\n",
